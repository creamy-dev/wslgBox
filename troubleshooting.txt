wslgBox - Troubleshooting
----------------------------

Can't run the file, because you don't have permissions?

Do 'chmod +rwx wslgbox' or 'chmod ugo+rwx wslgbox'. 

Xwayland is not installed!

Install Xwayland on your distribution (example: sudo apt install xwayland)

Get a dbus error, and a black screen?

Install dbus-x11 (I've heard of other people using dbus-1-dbg), and run dbus-launch as root. If this happens, you will have to run this on every WSL boot, or every time you get this error.
