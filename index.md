## wslgBox: Linux on Windows made easy and fun.

As long as you have Windows Insider build 21362+, Setting up KDE on Windows is easier than ever.  
Just run the installer script at [wslgBox-installer](https://github.com/creamy-dev/wslgBox-installer), and it's all set up!  

## But why?

I started this project to learn more shell scripting, and to easily load up desktop environments natively on wsl, without installing any third party tools! Thankfully Windows has made that possible, with wslg. And it's great!  
wsl2 is getting better than running Linux VMs, with some graphics acceleration (CUDA for NVidia) showing up. It would have been even better with actual desktop environments / window managers, so I coded this!
Ever since the 1st version, it is way more polished and easier to use, so you can try out Linux.
